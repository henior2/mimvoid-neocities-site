            <h1>Tools</h1>

            <p>Of course, I can't thank <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> enough for providing people a way to host their website!</p>

            <p>I used their built-in editor at first, but soon switched to my preferred editor. It's thanks to the <a href="https://neocities.org/cli">Neocities CLI</a> that I can edit this website on my computer and upload the files later.</p>

            <p>Speaking of my preferred editor, I like <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim">Neovim</a>! Unlike Neocities' editor (as far as I know), it supports LSPs (language server protocols) that can spot errors in your code and provide suggestions. Neovim is based on Vim keybindings, so navigating text files with just the keyboard is quick and easy. There is a learning curve, but it's fun once you get the hang of it. Plus, Neovim can be beautiful and very functional with the right plugins.</p>

            <p>Finally, <a href="https://browsersync.io/">Browsersync</a> helps me preview my website without pushing the changes to Neocities. There's no worry that I'll find my website broken only after I updated it. Not pushing files for every change is also less load on Neocities.</p>

            <h1>Design</h1>

            <p>This website's header font is <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a>, and the body font is <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/karla">Karla</a>.</p>

            <p>The colors are based on <a href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin Macchiato</a>.</p>

            <p>The icons are from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome.</a></p>

            <p>The overall design was inspired by TUIs (terminal user interfaces) and tiling window managers. I find them really charming for their simplicity and what they can do despite design constraints. There was not one single inspiration, but some of them include:</p>
          
            <ul>
              <li>Hyprland, a dynamic window manager with great graphics</li>
              <li>Dooit, a terminal to-do list</li>
              <li>Arttime, a terminal time tracker with ascii art</li>
            </ul>

            <p>They're also just nice projects in their own right!</p>
