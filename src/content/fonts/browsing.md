There are many well-known font websites out there—Google Fonts, 1001Fonts, DaFont, etc.
However, there are many more around the web that may be a little more obscure, but not
any less valuable!

## [Luc Devoye: Type Design](https://luc.devroye.org/fonts.html)

This is a wonderful and huge archive of fonts of various foundries and styles. It was made
with an encyclopedic treatment, so in addition to images of the fonts, it has information
on the foundries' history and such.

## [TypOasis](https://moorstation.org/typoasis/typoasis1.htm)

I've also included TypOasis in my site buttons, but it was too good to not elaborate on it.

The **Lost + Found** section includes many original files from foundries that have
otherwise shut down and no longer offer their fonts for download. You can probably trust them
to not alter anything like mass font aggregators may do.

## [localfonts.eu](https://localfonts.eu)

This website has both free and paid fonts. Even the free fonts are of pretty good quality.

It sorts its fonts by writing system, so it's super convenient find fonts that support
Cyrillic, Bulgarian Cyrillic, Serbian Cyrillic, Greek, etc.

## [Open Foundry](https://open-foundry.com)

Open Foundry curates open-source typefaces! They highlight specific members of a font family,
so a bold weight, for example, won't just be relegated to a subsection.

## [FontForge](https://fontforge.io)

Not to be confused with the [open-source font editor of the same name]({{% relref "creation#fontforge" %}}),
FontForge is a site dedicated to font pairings and typographic design. The fonts they list seem
to also be found on Google Fonts, but they display the fonts at different sizes and in various
pairings. It's good for discovering how to use a font in a way you never thought of before.

## [GitHub](https://github.com)

Yes, GitHub! Many open-source fonts host their source code on GitHub, meaning you can almost
guarantee the fonts you find there are free to use *and* modify. There are also small
projects that may be specific tweaks, mashups, etc. of preexisting fonts.

Be sure to support the developers and designers if you're able!

### Foundry Websites

Many type foundries have their own websites, often with striking visuals that properly display
their fonts' unique features, which more generic sites cannot put in the effort to make
(like this one, for example...). While they may have a comparatively limited collection,
they're often a great stepping stone from a popular font to find more obscure fonts by the
same foundry.

Some of my favorites include:

- [Collletttivo](https://www.collletttivo.it)
- [Etcetera Type Company](https://etceteratype.co)
- [Huerta Tipográfica](https://www.huertatipografica.com)
- [Noir Blanc Rouge](https://noirblancrouge.com)
- [Typodermic Fonts](https://typodermicfonts.com)
