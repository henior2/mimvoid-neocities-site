I've never had much of a liking toward serif fonts, except for those that were
first and foremost [display fonts]({{% relref "fonts/collections/display" %}}).

Nevertheless, there are a few that have won me over.

## EB Garamond

EB Garamond is one of my favorite serif body fonts. It's classy and gets the job done.

## Libre Baskerville

Libre Baskerville my go-to font for a printed book feel.
