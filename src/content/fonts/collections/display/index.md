Under Construction...

## Major Mono Display

Major Mono Display is among my all-time favorites. It's unique, interesting, and esoteric!

## DM Serif Display

I really like the contrast and class of this DM Serif variant.
It's become a habit of mine to use it for formal-ish college essays.

## Oswald

Like DM Serif Display, Oswald pairs well with a lot of sans serif body fonts.

## Baloo 2

<span class="primary">Variant</span>: 700 weight

{{% pangram font="Baloo 2" %}}

Baloo 2 is round and informal.

Its Latin writing system is nice, but it's actually primarily for South Asian scripts
like Devanagari, Bengali, Malayam, Telugu, and more!

Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to display them yet. Please see the source
for previews.
