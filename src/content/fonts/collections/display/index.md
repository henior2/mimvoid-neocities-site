Under Construction...

## Major Mono Display

{{% pangram font="Major Mono Display" %}}

Major Mono Display is among my all-time favorites. It's unique, interesting, and esoteric!

## DM Serif Display

{{% pangram font="DM Serif Display" %}}

I really like the contrast and class of this DM Serif variant.
It's become a habit of mine to use it for formal-ish college essays.

## Oswald

Like DM Serif Display, Oswald pairs well with a lot of sans serif body fonts.

## Baloo 2

<span class="primary">Variant</span>: 700 weight

{{% pangram font="Baloo 2" %}}

Baloo 2 is round and informal.

Its Latin writing system is nice, but it's actually primarily for South Asian scripts
like Devanagari, Bengali, Malayam, Telugu, and more!

Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to display them yet. Please see the source
for previews.

## Limelight

## Tsarevich

[Homepage](http://www.mishapanfilov.ru/font_tsarevich_en.html)

License: Free for commercial use (see homepage)

{{% pangram font="Tsarevich-Regular" lang="ru en" %}}

<span class="primary">Variant</span>: Light

{{% pangram font="Tsarevich-Light" lang="ru en" %}}

<span class="primary">Variant</span>: Bold

{{% pangram font="Tsarevich-Bold" lang="ru en" %}}

Tsarevich has a huge number of ligatures with interlocking letters! It's based on old
Russian calligraphy.

There is also an older version with a more handwritten and irregular look.

## Lkdown

[Typographic specimen](https://www.behance.net/gallery/95166229/Lkdown-Free-font?locale=en_US)

License: EULA (free for commerical use, see homepage)

{{% pangram font="Lkdown" lang="en ru" %}}

This font was designed during the lockdown in April 2020 by Mariano Diez, and the
Cyrillic set was by Denis Ignatov.

It's super cool, very futuristic and sci-fi or cyberpunk-esque.

## Rosarina
