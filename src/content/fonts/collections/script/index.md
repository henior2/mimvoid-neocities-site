## Script

### Betània Patmos

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="BetaniaPatmos" %}}

Betània Patmos is designed by Carolina Giovagnoli. The foundry Huerta Tipográfica has
other fonts that may sound familiar, Alegreya and Bitter!

### Playwrite

<span class="primary">Variant</span>: Playwrite Perú

{{% pangram font="Playwrite PE" lang="es" %}}

<span class="primary">Variant</span>: Playwrite Hrvatska

{{% pangram font="Playwrite HR" lang="hr" %}}

Playwrite is a huge font family with cursive styles from across the world.
The two samples above are some of my favorites, and are only a small fraction of
the handwriting models Playwrite portrays.

## Handwriting

### Itim

{{% pangram font="Itim" lang="th" punctuation=false %}}
{{% pangram font="Itim" %}}

Itim has such regularity that you can almost mistake it for a typical sans serif font with
round terminals. It has a subtlety that makes it perfect for clean yet playful designs.

### Rock Salt

### Shantell Sans

{{% pangram font="Shantell Sans" punctuation=false %}}
{{% pangram font="Shantell Sans" lang="ru" %}}

Shantell Sans is a wonderful and versatile font based on the handwriting of dyslexic
artist Shantell Martin. You might have heard of it as "the new Comic Sans" (in a positive way),
with a similar irregularity and personality.

They did a great job with the homepage presentation!

### Swanky and Moo Moo

[Homepage](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Swanky+and+Moo+Moo)

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Swanky and Moo Moo" %}}

This font is based on a young mother's handwriting and is named after her family's nicknames,
which I found adorable!

It reminds me a bit of my own handwriting too.

### Bad Script

[Source](https://github.com/alexeiva/badscript)

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Bad Script" punctuation=false %}}
{{% pangram font="Bad Script" lang="ru" %}}

It's name is rather ironic given how pretty I find it.

### Homemade Apple

{{% license "apache 2.0" %}}

{{% pangram font="Homemade Apple" %}}

What texture!

### Meow Script

[Homepage](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Meow+Script)

[Source](https://github.com/googlefonts/meow-script)

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Meow Script" %}}

I had to include this font, if only for the name alone. Plus, it's quite beautiful!

### Oooh Baby

[Homepage](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oooh+Baby)

[Source](https://github.com/googlefonts/oooh-baby)

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Oooh Baby" %}}

### Square Peg

### WindSong

[Homepage](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/WindSong)

[Source](https://github.com/googlefonts/windsong)

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="WindSong" %}}

I find WindSong very elegant and refined. Sometimes I use it to represent signatures.
