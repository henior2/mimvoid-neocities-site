My collections of nice fonts!

<!--more-->

## Files

All fonts here are files **hosted directly** on my website.

This is both for speed and for archival reasons. There's no dependency on a remote source
to serve the fonts. If they go down, update the files, or get redirected, these collections
will remain as they are. It's especially important to me for the more obscure fonts out there.

The fonts are in [WOFF2 format]({{% relref "/design/formats/fonts#woff2" %}})
or the most lightweight alternative (sorry if your browser doesn't support it, that's not my priority).
You can get the files for yourself if you were to inspect the website and find the path
to the font file.

It's **not recommended** though. I will not add a way to do that more easily. Please download
the fonts from their official sources, which usually offer more file formats and variants!

## Pangrams

## Special Thanks

- [google-webfonts-helper](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts) was a huge aid for me to
download Google Fonts in WOFF2 format.
