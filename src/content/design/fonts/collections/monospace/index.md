Monospace fonts are quintessential to programming and life in the terminal,
where their fixed width allows text to be displayed and aligned correctly.

Some are typewriter style fonts, great for formatting screenplays and the like.

## Source Code Pro

Nerd Font variant: [SauceCodePro][nf]

{{% pangram font="Source Code Pro" lang="ligatures" punctuation=false %}}

Source Code Pro is one of widest I've found among monospace fonts,
which gives it a nice round look.

## Hasklig

Nerd Font variant: [Hasklug][nf]

{{% pangram font="Hasklig" lang="ligatures" punctuation=false %}}

Hasklig is Source Code Pro with programming ligatures.
It was specifically geared toward [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org),
but can be seen with many other languages like JavaScript, Typescript,
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), [Gleam](https://gleam.run), and [OCaml](https://ocaml.org).

## Office Code Pro

A derivative of Source Code Pro, Office Code Pro is slightly taller with
a few different glyph styles.

## Fira Code

Nerd Font variant: [FiraCode][nf]

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Fira Code" %}}

{{% pangram font="Fira Code" lang="ligatures" punctuation=false %}}

Fira Code is super popular among developers, particularly for its abundance
of programming ligatures.

## Victor Mono

Nerd Font variant: [VictorMono][nf]

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Victor Mono" %}}

{{% pangram font="Victor Mono" lang="ligatures" punctuation=false %}}

<div style="font-style: italic">
    {{% pangram font="Victor Mono" %}}
</div>

Victor Mono is distinct for its cursive italics, which can make
special keywords really stand out while programming.

It's a nice alternative to fonts like
[Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview).

## Courier Prime

<div style="font-style: italic">
    {{% pangram font="Courier Prime" %}}
</div>

<span class="primary">Variant</span>: Courier Prime Sans

[Source](https://github.com/quoteunquoteapps/CourierPrimeSans)

{{% pangram font="Courier Prime Sans" %}}

<div style="font-style: italic">
    {{% pangram font="Courier Prime Sans" %}}
</div>

Oh, a screenplay font this time!

[Courier Prime was made to improve upon Courier](https://johnaugust.com/2013/introducing-courier-prime),
which was designed in 1955 for IBM and became the standard for screenwriting (A repository of
[the original Courier's digital forms can be found here](https://github.com/dse/font-og-courier)).

Courier Prime is my favorite typewriter style font, and I love its italics. There is also
Courier Prime Code, which is Courier Prime Sans but code-optimized.
