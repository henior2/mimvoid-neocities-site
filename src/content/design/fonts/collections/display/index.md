Major Mono Display is among my all-time favorites. It's just so unique,
interesting, and esoteric!

## DM Serif Display

I really like the contrast of this display variant.
It's become a habit of mine to use it for formal-ish college essays.

Like DM Serif Display, Oswald pairs well with a lot of sans serif body fonts.

## Baloo 2

Baloo 2 is round and informal. This one is the 700 weight version.

While its Latin writing system is nice, it primarily South Asian scripts
like Devanagari, Bengali, Malayam, Telugu, and more.

Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to display them yet. Please see the source
for previews!

## SoukouMincho

{{% pangram font="SoukouMincho" lang="ja" %}}

Designer Kato Masashi (加藤雅士) from Flop Design derived SoukouMincho (装甲明朝)
from Source Han Serif.

I love this font for its contrast!

Sometime between 20 March and 15 May 2022, the original website went down. The linked
