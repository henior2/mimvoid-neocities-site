Hi there, I'm **mimvoid**!

I made this website as my own little space on the internet.

You will find me sharing my many interests:
<span class="secondary">biology, art, design, software,</span>
and other goodies:

- [Font collections]({{% relref "/design/fonts/collections" %}})
- [Media file formats]({{% relref "/design/formats" %}})
- Interesting algae
- Neat open-source software
- [My story ideas and worlds]({{% relref "/worlds" %}})!

Linked in the footer are [my website's source code](https://github.com/mimvoid/neocities-site)
and [useful resources]({{% relref "/credits" %}}).
Feel free to take a look if anything piques your interest
and use them for your own website!

I believe in recording sources and dates. See anything without a citation?
Or even have an interesting source you'd like me to check out? Please let me know!

That's it for this introduction. Click on any links that interest you!

I hope you have fun~!
