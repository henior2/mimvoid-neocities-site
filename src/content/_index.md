Hi there, I'm **mimvoid**!

I made this website as my own little space on the internet.

You will find me sharing my many interests:
<span class="secondary">biology, art, design, software,</span>
and other goodies:

- [Font collections]({{% relref "/design/fonts/collections" %}})
- [Media file formats]({{% relref "/design/formats" %}})
- Interesting algae
- Neat open-source software for different OSes
- In a future update, maybe even my story ideas...?

And so on, and so on...

In the spirit of open source, linked in the footer is
[my website's source code](https://github.com/mimvoid/neocities-site)
and resources that helped to create this website. Feel free to
take a look if anything piques your interest and use it for your own website!

I believe in citing sources and recording dates. See anything without a citation?
Or even have an interesting source you'd like me to check out? Please let me know!

That's it for this introduction. Click on any links that interest you!

I hope you have fun!
