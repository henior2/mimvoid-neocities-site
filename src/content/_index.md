# Welcome and Salutations!

<sa>~ This site is under construction! ~</sa>

Hi there, I'm mimvoid!

I made this little site as a casual project to have my own little space on the internet. You will find me talking about my many interests, from biology, art, software, and other such goodies:

- Interesting algae
- Neat open-source software for different OSes
- Image file formats
- In a future update, maybe even my story ideas...?

And so on, and so on...

In the spirit of open source, I have my website's [source code](https://github.com/mimvoid/neocities-site) linked in the footer, and a list of resources I used to help create this website. Feel free to take a look if anything piques your interest, and use some of it for your own website as long as you abide by the license (i.e. also make it open source)!

I also believe in citing sources and recording dates for my work. See anything without a citation? Or even have an interesting source you'd like me to check out? Please let me know!

That's about it for this brief introduction. Click on any links that interest you. I hope you have fun!
