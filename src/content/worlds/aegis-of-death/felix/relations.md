### [Malachi Xie]({{% relref "malachi" %}})

**Relation**: Friends

"This idiot is too naive for his own good, too easily provoked, and too clueless about
something as simple as himself. It's a miracle he's lasted as long as he has. One day or
another, he'll be gone.

"In the meantime, I'll at least help him investigate everything. He might hold the
best clue we have. Besides, it's the first time I've been able to bounce these sorts of
ideas off an actual person. Even if he might mess everything up...I'll keep him around for
as long as I can."

### [Sonya Antonovna Sokolova]({{% relref "sonya" %}})

**Relation**: Sister

"Sonya's...one of the hardest people to be around. She's too nosy and always asking how
your day's been and what she could do to help. Not like she's honest herself when the
tables are flipped.

"Things would be so much easier if she didn't actually care so much. Then I wouldn't
have to consider her feelings on top of everything else."

### [Everett Dayal]({{% relref "everett" %}})

**Relation**: Acquaintance

"I only know Everett a little through Sonya. They're intriguing, at least. I just keep
wondering why Masha—that's our cat—liked them. She usually hates strangers."

### Nataliya Ivanovna Sokolova

**Relation**: Mother

"What's that phrase again? Wishful thinking? I wish I didn't care about her."

### Anton Romanovich Sokolov

**Relation**: Father

"What do you want me to say? That 'I'm grateful for him keeping a roof over our heads'
and blah blah blah? Yeah, tough luck buddy."
