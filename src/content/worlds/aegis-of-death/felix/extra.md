Felix is a little bastard and the youngest of the main cast, though not by too much.

Like [Sonya]({{% relref "sonya" %}}), his gender is a pretty important part of his
character. When it comes to anything remotely vulnerable, expect his words to be
deflected a little to the left.

## Origin

Felix was always meant to be Sonya's little brother, but he used to be dead before
the story began. He was Sonya's main source of self esteem issues, always willing to
help others to be praised, and sacrificed himself to save his family.

What angel compared to how he is now, haha.

I've since developed him into a character in his own right, and another angle on
Aegis of Death's main themes and motifs.

## Design

I made Felix's color palette lighter than the rest of the main cast, especially
[Malachi]({{% relref "malachi" %}}). He's in the blinding light, while Malachi's
refined to the dark.

I would have given him ginger hair like Sonya if it didn't look way too warm for his
character. Instead, I settled on mildly strawberry blond hair.

His eyes are sharp and upturned, almost like a cat. Sometimes, I even draw them
with a pupil.
