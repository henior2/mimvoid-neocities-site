It has only been a decade since the first reported resurrections and contact with The Herald.

It does not listen to our requests. It chooses what it wants.

It chooses those suffering at death, and grants them their dying wish.

It's interesting, isn't it, to be able to cheat death? To have another chance,

### Shadows

Things of mist and eyes and an enmity toward humanity.

The more eyes it has, the more developed and powerful it seems to become.
If you listen closely, you can almost hear voices.

When a shadow possesses a human corpse, the result is called a **parasite**.

Parasites fully capable of mimicking humans are designated **███ █████████**.
