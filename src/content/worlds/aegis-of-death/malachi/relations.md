"There's a lot I can say about Everett... They've given me a place to stay, even though
they work for the AOD. I know it's risky. They've threatened me about stepping out of line
and I've seen them slice a whole shadow into pieces. But they can also be so sympathetic
and gentle that I really believe it, and I want to believe it.

"Some days, I hardly see them around. I almost get the feeling they're scared of me in their
own house...

"We both know I'm not telling the whole story. But if it keeps the truce, then that's that.
I'll need any help I can get."

{{< relation page="../felix" rel="Ally" class="polaroid" >}}

"Felix knows a lot about technology I can hardly wrap my head around, and he's one of the
few out there who's actually interested in shadows. He always comes running to me with new ideas
and leads. It's impressive, even if it's given him an ego that's probably bore holes through
his skull.

"He's so...what's the right word...independent? I don't think I would have been able to
accomplish nearly as much. But if I had a normal life, maybe I could at least have done
something impressive too? Ugh, I don't even want to think about him anymore."
