### [Everett Dayal]({{% relref "everett" %}})

**Relation**: Harborer?

"There's a lot I can say about Everett... They've given me a place to stay, even though
they work for the AOD. I know it's risky. They've threatened me about stepping out of line
and I've seen them slice a whole shadow into pieces. But they can also be so sympathetic
and gentle that I really believe it, and I want to believe it.

"Some days, I hardly see them around. I almost get the feeling they're scared of me in their
own house...

"We both know I'm not telling the whole story. But if it keeps the truce, then that's that.
I'll need any help I can get."

### [Felix Antonovich Sokolov]({{% relref "felix" %}})

**Relation**: Ally

"Felix is awfully smart, and he knows a lot about technology I had no idea existed.
His interest in shadows means we have a common goal, so we've been helping each other
think of ideas and find new leads. He's impressive, even if it's given him an ego that knows
exactly how to get on my nerves.

"I don't think I would have been able to accomplish nearly as much, at least, I don't think.
But if I had a normal life, maybe I could at least have done something impressive too?
Ugh, I don't even want to think about it anymore."

### [Mystery Girl]({{% relref "sonya" %}})

**Relation**: "Partners in crime"

TBA

### [Anastasia Xie]({{% relref "anastasia" %}})

**Relation**: Half sister

"Her... I'd rather not talk about it."
