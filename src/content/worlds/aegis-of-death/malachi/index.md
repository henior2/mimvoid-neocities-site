### [Everett Dayal]({{% relref "everett" %}})

**Relation**: Harborer?

"Everett? There's a lot I can say about them...

"Well, they're the one who's giving me a place to stay. But at the same time, they work for
the AOD. They've threatened me before and I've seen them slice a whole shadow into pieces.
But they can also be so sympathetic that I can almost believe they'd never hurt a fly.

"Oh, and Everett sleeps on the couch a lot, and also hides themselves in their room for days.
Sometimes, I get the feeling they're scared of me in their own house...

"Basically, they're really tough to figure out. I can't tell what they're thinking, and it
worries me. But I'll take any help I can get. I just need a plan in case they change their mind.
For now, we're fine."

### [Felix Antonovich Sokolov]({{% relref "felix" %}})

**Relation**: Friends?

"When he found me, I thought I was caught for good.

"Felix is awfully smart, and he knows a lot about technology I had no idea existed.
He's graduated from high school, has a job, *and* he's looking into shadows in his spare time.
It's impressive, even if it's given him an ego that knows exactly how to get on my nerves.

"I don't think I would have been able to do nearly as much, at least, I don't think. But if I
had a normal life, maybe I could at least have done something impressive too? Ugh, I don't even
want to think about it anymore."

### [Mystery Girl]({{% relref "sonya" %}})

**Relation**: "Partners in crime"

TBA

### [Anastasia Xie]({{% relref "anastasia" %}})

**Relation**: Half sister

"Her... I'd rather not talk about it."
