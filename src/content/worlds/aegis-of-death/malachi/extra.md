Despite being the protagonist of Aegis of Death, Malachi has historically been one of the
hardest characters for me to get into the headspace of...

He didn't even have a compelling motivation for a while, just being a runaway. He has,
however, grown on me after I added an uncertainty to his own identity. Sorry buddy, into
the dissociation bin you go~

## Origin

Malachi was actually a side character in an early and unserious iteration of Aegis of Death.
He was called Nikolai, a sort of gruff bad boy who skipped class and was hiding from his sister
[Anastasia]({{% relref "anastasia" %}}). She was a cold-hearted black market dealer back then
who hired [Everett]({{% relref "everett" %}}), then an independent monster hunter, to get
her brother/experiment subject back. Ah, fun times.

Malachi has always had a shadow motif, though the entities themselves didn't come about
until later.

## Design

Malachi has a lot of elements on him that resemble shadows, even his hair. Malachi's connection
to shadows used to be a mystery, but it became a little silly given how obvious it was.
