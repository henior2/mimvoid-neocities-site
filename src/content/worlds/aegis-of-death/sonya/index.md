## File 3: Relationships {.section}

### [Everett Dayal]({{% relref "everett" %}})

**Relation**: Coworker

"Everett's a really sweet kid, super polite and kind. They weren't really in the best place
when we first met, but Deuce helped them get back on their feet, and I'm glad I can also
be there for them now.

"Maybe it's just me being a worrywart, but I keep thinking if I should be doing more for
them somehow, if that makes sense? I don't know, I just get the sense that something's wrong."

### [Halle Auclair]({{% relref "halle" %}})

**Relation**: Coworker, high school friend

"Hal and I go way back. Who knew luck would have us working together?
She's such a straightlace, always talking my ear off about the littlest things. It's not like
I mind it though. More often than not, she's right.

"We still hang out sometimes, but we're not as close since things fell apart some time ago."

### [Deuce]({{% relref "deuce" %}})

**Relation**: Boss

"Eh, we tolerate each other for work, but we don't really get along. I don't know, he's just
a little too...rational? I don't think he likes me either. Probably my attitude or whatever.

"*Everett* likes him though. Maybe I should give him some slack...?"

### [Somebody]({{% relref "malachi" %}})

**Relation**: "Partners in crime"

TBA

### [Felix Antonovich Sokolov]({{% relref "felix" %}})

**Relation**: Brother

"The Pen Freak's my little brother (emphasis on *little*)! We don't see each other as often anymore,
what with work and all. I'd fight him on the spot though (and win).

"...Come to think of it, when was the last time I really actually talked with Felya? I kind of
wish he'd open up a little more. With all the things he's already doing at that age—that's
gotta take a lot. Hmm. I should call him later today."

### Nataliya Ivanovna Sokolova

**Relation**: Mother

"...Mom. You know, the world's really cruel with luck sometimes. I should visit her more.
I wish I could do more."

### Anton Romanovich Sokolov

**Relation**: Father

"He works a lot to support everyone. Honestly, he's always been a workaholic, but it
ramped up even more after my mom fell ill. At least I can help now. Being a field operator
pays really well."
