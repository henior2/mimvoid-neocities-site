It might seem cliche to for Sonya to be the only girl and the emotionally attentive character
of the main cast. But trust me when I say there's more going on underneath, and being a woman
is crucial to her character.

Hint: eldest daughter, a multitude of regrets, survivor's guilt, and flight response.

## Origin

Sonya's a pretty old character. Her design came about in a body type doodle as the hourglass.
She had a sort of strawberry pastry theme with hints of country girl that can still be
seen in her hair. Younger me thought she was so pretty that she became a recurrent character,
ending up in Aegis of Death, then called Angel of Death.

Her character admittedly used to be pretty flat and yandere-esque haha.

## Design

Sonya's one of my favorites in Aegis of Death (they're almost all my favorites, but still)
for her design alone.

I made sure to give her a very distinct silhouette and shape repetitions. She's round and
pointy, friendly and active. The diamonds are for Myr Division 02.

Her eyes are a very disinct teardrop shape, which I don't use too often (it was more common
in my old art style). There's not much definition to her irises, which gives a sort of glassy
appearance.
