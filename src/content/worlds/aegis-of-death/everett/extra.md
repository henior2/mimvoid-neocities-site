Everett my child, my baby, my blorbo, my pathetic little meow meow.

## Origin

Like Nixie, Everett originated many, many years back from a villain character in a
childhood show, Balala the Fairies: Over the Rainbow. I was so frustrated with the lack of
nuance in the villains that I made my own headcanons, and what was once a fanon interpretation
gradually diverged into its own character.

## Gender

As you might have noticed, Everett uses they/he pronouns!

How Everett came to be nonbinary is kind of a funny story actually. During one of
my brainstorming sessions, I sort of just realized that it didn't feel right to see him
as a completely cis guy. Okay, nonbinary it was.

Given that I happened to project onto Everett a lot, and how they had autism and ADHD
traits way before I was diagnosed, maybe that said more about me than it did about them...

## Design

Everett's defining colors are deep red and teal, dangerous and soothing at the same time.

Their flared sleeves and pants were meant to somewhat resemble the robes of an angel
(the humanoid angels of the lowest order detailed in *De Coelesti Hierarchia*, equally
Biblically accurate as the thrones and the seraphims).

Their one eye has a very large and round iris with an unfocused or doe-eyed look.
It has a blobby undefined edge like liquid, which I like to exaggerate for certain expressions.
