### Ability

**Name**: Refraction

**Description**

Everett can transfer wounds to the last entity with which they had physical contact.
Such entities have only found to be humans, shadows, and parasites.

Activation can be triggered manually or automatically after death.

An indication leading up to ability activation is the formation of a floating
ring of blood above their head, reminiscent of a halo.

After activation, Everett's transferred wounds heal at an abnormally fast pace.
No blood is recovered and no foreign bodies removed.

### [Malachi Xie]({{% relref "malachi" %}})

**Relation**: ???

"Malachi...is an enigma. He's on the AOD's radar, but they want him turned in *alive*.
I don't know where he came from, or why he's in hiding. I don't even know if—at least
I *think it is*—if what he says is right or wrong or...

"...I know this is probably the worst decision and this will go terribly wrong and I'm going
to regret it in the future and for the rest of my life but—I can't do it. Not another. Not
when everything's on me. I just need to understand, then I'll hand him in... I just have to
know more."

### [Sonya Antonovna Sokolova]({{% relref "sonya" %}})

**Relation**: Coworker

"Sonya's really good at making decisions in the moment, and she can talk to the people we
have to talk to for our missions. She's like a shining beacon—bright, cheerful, confident,
accomplished...I guess you could say I admire her a lot.

"We hang out outside of work occasionally, talking about anything that comes to mind. It's
nice, even if it's a little draining—don't tell her that, though. I don't want her
to feel bad because of me."

### [Deuce]({{% relref "deuce" %}})

**Relation**: Boss

"Honestly, I owe everything to Deuce. He's the one that helped me get back on my feet and
welcomed me to the AOD. If I hadn't met him—if The Herald hadn't saved me—I don't know where
I would have gone. <span class="small"><em>Probably not here at all...</em></span>

"He handles much of the logistics and paperwork for Division 02, so he's busy even
outside of missions. He said he doesn't enjoy it very much. I'm at least able to keep him
company though. Return the favor somewhat, I suppose.

"There's more I can share, but I'm not supposed to say too much. Sorry."

### [Halle Auclair]({{% relref "halle" %}})

**Relation**: Coworker

"Halle's usually the one who radios in during our missions, giving the details. She's
pretty good at it, even if she can be a little strict. And angry. And loud. Especially with Sonya.

"She might say she prefers me for actually listening to her, but I can tell she and Sonya
are pretty close. Sometimes I feel like I'm intruding, so I just let them be."

### [Aisling Fitzpatrick]({{% relref "aisling" %}})

**Relation**: Coworker

"Aisling has actually been in the AOD for longer than I have, but we didn't meet
until a while later, since she's not around much. It makes sense, given she's only 12
years old.

"Somehow, she's come to trust me the most? Within Division 02, as far as I can tell.
I just supervise and talk with her sometimes. Maybe babysitting is the right word...?"

### Tara Dayal

**Relation**: Mother

"This is the name of my mother, according to my documents. Sometimes I wonder
what my life would have have been like if she was still alive. Maybe it's better that
I don't know."
