            <p>Hi there, I'm mimvoid!</p>

            <p>I made this little site as a casual project to have my own little space on the internet. You will find me talking about my many interests, from biology, art, software, and other such goodies:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Interesting algae</li>
              <li>Neat open-source software for different OSes</li>
              <li>Image file formats</li>
              <li>In a future update, maybe even my story ideas...?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And so on, and so on...</p>

            <p>In the spirit of open source, I have my website's <a href="https://github.com/mimvoid/neocities-site">source code</a> linked in the footer, and a list of resources I used to help create this website. Feel free to take a look at it if anything piques your interest, and use some of it for your own website as long as you abide by the license (i.e. also make it open source)!</p>

            <p>I also believe in citing sources and recording dates for my work. See anything that I haven't managed to cite? Or even have an interesting source you'd like me to check out? Please let me know!</p>

            <p>That's about it for this brief introduction. Click on any links that interest you. I hope you have fun!</p>

            <p>~ (More decorations coming soon) ~</p>
