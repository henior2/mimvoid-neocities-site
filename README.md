This is the source code for my [Neocities website][1].

It includes code for neat little features like:

- Importing fonts
- Including icons

Further resources can be found on my [credits page][2].

I can't guarantee that the code will be pleasant to read, since this is a casual project with relatively loose standards. But I'll be happy if you still find it helpful!
