This is the source code for my [Neocities website](https://mimvoid.neocities.org).

It includes code for neat little features like:

- Javascript to put a header, footer, and sidebar on every page
- Importing fonts
- How I include icons

Further resources can be found on my [credits page](https://mimvoid.neocities.org/credits).

I can't guarantee that the code will be pleasant to read, since this is a casual, work-in-process project with relatively loose standards. But I'll be happy if you still find it helpful!
